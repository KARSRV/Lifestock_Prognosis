# 🐄 Livestock Disease Prediction System

A Machine Learning-powered web application to predict diseases in livestock based on symptoms and external features such as temperature and age. Built using Django (backend), HTML/CSS (frontend), and ensemble models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and CatBoost for accurate disease classification.
